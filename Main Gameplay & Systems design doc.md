## Main Gameplay Loop

### **__Core Gameplay__**
- Use **Dungeon Key** to get into the dungeon
- Get compass pointing to **artifact** location within the dungeon
- Find **artifact**
- Leave dungeon
- Get rewards
- Repeat

---

### **__Dungeon Keys__**

Players will spend **1x key** to go into the dungeon

Dungeon keys will be limited, player can claim **free** two keys **every day**
- When daily free key refreshes, display it in MOTD to remind player they can play again
  
Players can also get more dungeon keys from completing **daily quests/objectives**
- More incentive for players to join more often/daily

Dungeon keys can also be bought with **crowns**
- Conversion rate **3x crown** -> **1x dungeon key** _(can be adjusted later on depending on how hard it is to get crowns)_

---

### **__Daily Quests/Objectives__**

Every day, players will have 3 random daily quests/objectives to complete within the dungeon. 2 of which should be **normal difficulty** and one **sculk difficulty**. Sculk difficulty quests require you to go further into the dungeon and are overall harder to complete

Example **normal difficulty** daily quests/objectives:
- Collect **3x Frost Ember** within one run _(excluding frost embers from artifact)_
- Complete a run with **Clank level** being less than **10**
- Explore **5 unique areas** within the dungeon

Example **sculk difficulty** daily quests/objectives:
- Collect **6x Frost Ember** within one run _(excluding frost embers from artifact)_
- Escape the dungeon with a **Level 2 Artifact**
- Collect **2x Crown** within one run
- Escape the dungeon with a **Level 2 Artifact** without triggering **Aggro-net**

---

The rewards for completing **normal difficulty** daily quests/objectives are:
- **1x Dungeon Key**
- **3x Amethyst Shard**
- **100x EXP**
  
The rewards for completing **sculk difficulty** daily quests/objectives are:
- **2x Dungeon Key**
- **1x Amethyst flower** (proper name TBD)
- **3x Amethyst Shard**
- **250x EXP**

---

### **__Treasure / Frost Embers__**

Player can find **Coins**, **Crowns**, **Frost Embers** and **Amethyst Shards** around the map, depending on their cards
- Same as HC Decked Out 2
- Amethyst Shards not affected by cards

### **__Artifacts__**

Once player follows their compass to the artifact spot, they can drop it and if the block is correct, they will received artifact with level matching their floor level
- The artifact spot will have buffer of 1.5 blocks around the main spot so players dont have to guess and throw the artifacts on blocks around to figure out which block it actually is

Once the player gets their artifact, they will immidiately get **+3 Clank level**. Their goal now will be escaping the dungeon (or optionally staying longer and collecting treasure/frost embers)

There should be good variety of artifacts, each with varying frost ember reward
