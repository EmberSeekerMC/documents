# Ember Seeker

A [Decked Out 2](https://hermitcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Decked_Out_2) insipired rogue-like Minecraft server

## Main Gameplay Loop

### **__Core Gameplay__**
- Use **Dungeon Key** to get into the dungeon
- Get compass pointing to **artifact** location within the dungeon
- Find **artifact**
- Leave dungeon
- Get rewards
- Repeat

---

### The Dungeon

The dungeon will be randomly generated. There will be two types of dungeons:
- Weekly Dungeon
  - The standard dungeon, generated at the start of the week. This will keep the aspect of remembering the dungeon while also not having same dungeon forever
- Challange Dungeon
  - Randomly generated dungeon every time its played
  - Hazard triggers more often 
  - Aggro-net has increased detection radius
  - Ravagers do more damage
  - Less food around the dungeon
  - Some unique rooms and builds specificaly for this mode
  - You can bring 3 less cards than to normal dungeon
  - Rewards and luck of getting good cards at the end greatly increased

**Ideas for more potentional dungeon types in the future (could maybe rotate weekly/monthly):**
- Timed Dungeon
  - New dungeon every time
  - Something between challange dungeon and standard dungeon in terms of difficulty
  - Central clock like Sands of Time
  - Find time fragments around the map like treasure and frost embers and bring them to the middle to add more time
- Coop Dungeon
  - new dungeon every 2 days
  - idk just coop, difficulty increased probably 
  - would need some cool coop elements (portal 2 coop for inspiration)
- Randomizer Dungeon
  - Random deck every time
  - New dungeon every time

### **__Dungeon Keys__**

Players will spend **1x key** to go into the dungeon

Dungeon keys will be limited, player can claim **free** two keys **every day**
- When daily free key refreshes, display it in MOTD to remind player they can play again
  
Players can also get more dungeon keys from completing **daily quests/objectives**
- More incentive for players to join more often/daily

Dungeon keys can also be bought with **crowns**
- Conversion rate **3x crown** -> **1x dungeon key** _(can be adjusted later on depending on how hard it is to get crowns)_

---

### **__Daily Quests/Objectives__**

Every day, players will have 3 random daily quests/objectives to complete within the dungeon. 2 of which should be **normal difficulty** and one **sculk difficulty**. Sculk difficulty quests require you to go further into the dungeon and are overall harder to complete

Example **normal difficulty** daily quests/objectives:
- Collect **3x Frost Ember** within one run _(excluding frost embers from artifact)_
- Complete a run with **Clank level** being less than **10**
- Explore **5 unique areas** within the dungeon

Example **sculk difficulty** daily quests/objectives:
- Collect **6x Frost Ember** within one run _(excluding frost embers from artifact)_
- Escape the dungeon with a **Level 2 Artifact**
- Collect **2x Crown** within one run
- Escape the dungeon with a **Level 2 Artifact** without triggering **Aggro-net**

---

The rewards for completing **normal difficulty** daily quests/objectives are:
- **1x Dungeon Key**
- **3x Amethyst Shard**
- **100x EXP**
  
The rewards for completing **sculk difficulty** daily quests/objectives are:
- **2x Dungeon Key**
- **1x Amethyst flower** (proper name TBD)
- **3x Amethyst Shard**
- **250x EXP**

---

### **__Treasure / Frost Embers__**

Player can find **Coins**, **Crowns**, **Frost Embers** and **Amethyst Shards** around the map, depending on their cards
- Same as HC Decked Out 2
- Amethyst Shards not affected by cards

### **__Artifacts__**

Once player follows their compass to the artifact spot, they can drop it and if the block is correct, they will received artifact with level matching their floor level
- The artifact spot will have buffer of 1.5 blocks around the main spot so players dont have to guess and throw the artifacts on blocks around to figure out which block it actually is

Once the player gets their artifact, they will immidiately get **+3 Clank level**. Their goal now will be escaping the dungeon (or optionally staying longer and collecting treasure/frost embers)

There should be good variety of artifacts, each with varying frost ember reward

**__Artifact List__:**

## Other Systems

### Gacha for cosmetics.

yee cosmetics wooo.

  - Uses **Amethyst Flowers** to do a "offering" to a shrine. The gods or wahtever respond with cosmetics
    - Every **5 pulls** guaranteed **4 star** cosmetic
    - Every **50 pulls** guaranteed **5 star** cosmetic
    - Soft pity at **40 pulls**
    - **NEEDS to have cool satisfying animation**
- Amethyst flowers can be found in the dungeon or crafted from **6 Amethyst shards**
- Recycling unwanted cosmetics maybe? idk maybe for the future updates, doesnt need to be there for 1.0

### Deck/Player Showcase

Bunch of NPCs around the hub that players can click on and see their deck and stats
- Will rotate every once in a while (10-15 minutes?)
- Featured players must have at least once card thats not on starting deck in their deck
- Featured players must have completed at least 1 dungeon run

Maybe make players also have signatures like in genshin and be able to pin their best cards and artifacts they have found to their profile?


feel free to add any more ideas below

## Other Ideas

### Bombs
- Could be items you find around like treasure and frost embers
- Would be used for exploding shortcuts through the dungeon and maybe avoid some hazards
